   As a user, I want to log in by entering my email and password and clicking the **Login** button so that I can access my account.

3. **Error Feedback on Signup/Login**  
   As a user, I want to receive an error message if I try to sign up without entering my details, or if I enter the wrong email/password when logging in so that I know what went wrong.
